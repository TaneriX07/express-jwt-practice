## JWT Practice
A simple mock login form to practice using JWT

### Get Started
1. Install all dependecies
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the app (nodemon)
    ```
    npm start
    ```
3. Visit the site at your browser at port 3000 by default or assign a value to PORT in your env
   ```
   https://localhost/3000
   ```

### Usage
When the user submit the form, the app will check whether both username and password are provided. If so then the app will send back a token to the front-end which allow user to get data in the dashboard.
